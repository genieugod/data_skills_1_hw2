# Due date: Sunday April 9th before midnight
# Write your answers in the space between the questions, and commit/push only 
# this file to your repo. Note that there can be a difference between giving a
# "minimally" right answer, and a really good answer, so it can pay to put 
# thought into your work.

# Question 1: Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments, then
# sums them together.  If the sum is greater than 10, return the string 
# "big", if it is equal to 10, return "just right", and if it is less than
# 10, return "small".  Apply the function to each tuple of values in the 
# following list, with the end result being another list holding the strings 
# your function generates (e.g. ["big", "big", "small"]).

start_list = [(10, 0), (100, 4), (0, 0), (-15, -100), (5, 4)]



# Question 2: The following code is fully-functional, but uses a global
# variable and a local variable.  Re-write it to work the same, but using an
# argument and a local variable.  Use no more than two lines of comments to
# explain why this new way is preferable to the old way.

a = 10
def my_func():
    b = 30
    return a + b
x = my_func()


# Question 3: Write a function that can generate a random password from
# upper-case and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters 
# (!@#$%^&*).  It should have an argument for password length, and should 
# check to make sure the length is between 8 and 16, or else warn the user 
# and exit.  Your function should also have a keyword argument named 
# "special_chars" that defaults to True.  If the function is called with the 
# keyword argument set to False instead, then the random values chosen should
# not include special characters.  Create a second similar keyword argument 
# for numbers. Use one of the two libraries below.
#import random
#from numpy import random
  
  
  
# Question 4: Create a class that requires four arguments when an instance
# is created: one for the person's name, one for which COVID vaccine they
# have had, one for how many doses they've had, and one for whether they've
# ever had COVID.  Then create instances for four people:
#
# Aaron, Moderna, 3, False
# Ashu, Pfizer, 2, False
# Alison, none, 0, True
# Asma, Pfizer, 1, True
#
# Write two methods for this class, and one function:
# The first method named "get_record", which prints out a one-sentence summary
# of a specified person's records (e.g. Ashu has two doses of Phizer and...)
#
# The second method named "same_shot", which takes as an argument another person's
# record instance, and then prints whether or not the two people have the
# same kind of vaccine or not.
#
# A function named "all_data", which takes a container holding any number of these 
# instances and returns a simple list of all of their data 
# (e.g. [name, vaccine, doses, covid], [...])
